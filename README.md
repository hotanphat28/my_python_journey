# My Python Journey

Welcome to "My Python Journey"! This repository documents my progress and projects as I learn and explore the Python programming language.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following sections:

### 1. [Tutorials](tutorials/README.md)
This directory contains a collection of scripts and web applications:

- **CLI Menu**: A `main.py` script to navigate and run the various tutorials.

### 2. Learnings
