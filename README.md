# My Python Journey

Welcome to "My Python Journey"! This repository documents my progress and projects as I learn and explore the Python programming language.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main sections:

### 1. [Projects](projects/README.md)
This directory contains larger, standalone applications and tools I have built.
- **Flask Applications**: Web applications built with the Flask framework (e.g., Netflix Clone).
- **Image Resizer**: A desktop GUI tool for resizing and processing images.
- **Background Remover**: A tool to remove backgrounds from images.

### 2. [Tutorials](tutorials/README.md)
